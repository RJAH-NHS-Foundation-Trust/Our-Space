      Trust your instincts. If you don't feel safe, do not approach a stranger. You don’t have to do it alone either. If you don’t feel confident speaking to a person yourself, you can speak to a passer-by or if you are at a train station, find a member of staff or police officer.

It’s important to remember that if you’re concerned for your safety or the safety of someone else at any time, call 999.

      It can take a while for someone who is having difficult thoughts to realise they are being spoken to. It might seem like they’re not listening. Be patient; stay in their line of sight if you can and just let them know that you’re there. When you feel ready, you can try and talk to them again.

      If the person acts defensive or looks uncomfortable, it's best to alert someone to help. There is no right or wrong way to approach someone, and you don’t need special training to help – you just need to start a conversation. Simply talking to someone and interrupting their thoughts may be all it takes to encourage them to seek support.

      There is no evidence that intervening when someone is at risk will make the situation worse and there’s no perfect way to make an intervention, just do your best. By simply being there and showing you care, you could make a difference even if they don’t respond right away.
