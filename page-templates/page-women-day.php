        <h3>Accelerate Action</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">Collectively, we can <STRONG>Accelerate Action</strong> for gender equality.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">Step forward in solidarity for International Women's Day (IWD) 2025 on March 8 to help #AccelerateAction.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">At the current rate of progress, it will take until 2158, which is roughly five generations from now, to reach full gender parity, according to data from the World Economic Forum.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">Focusing on the need to Accelerate Action emphasizes the importance of taking swift and decisive steps to achieve gender equality. It calls for increased momentum and urgency in addressing the systemic barriers and biases that women face, both in personal and professional spheres.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">So, together, let's Accelerate Action to speed up the rate of progress worldwide.</p>
