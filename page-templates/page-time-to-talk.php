                        <p>Time to Talk Day 2024 revealed that nearly two thirds of the UK public put on a brave face to avoid talking about their mental health. And nearly half of us are less likely to open up as we don't want to worry others in already difficult times.</p>
                        <p>But talking openly and honestly can be the first step towards better mental health for everyone. It can reduce stigma and help people feel comfortable enough to seek help when they need it.</p>
                        <p>That's why this Time To Talk Day, we want everyone to get comfortable and start talking about mental health.</p>

        <h2>Supporting someone else</h2>
        <p class="text-dark">If someone opens up about their mental health to you, we know it might not always feel easy to know what to say. But it doesn’t have to be awkward – just being there for someone can make a big difference. If someone does confide in you, there are a number of things you could do;</p>

                        <p>Asking questions can give the person space to express how they’re feeling and what they’re going through. Try to ask questions that are open and non-judgmental, like ‘what does that feel like?’</P>
